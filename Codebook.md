# Codebook

## purpose
This codebook is meant to expand on the variables laid out in features_info.txt contained in the data folder obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

For a full explanation of how these signals were collected and processed, refer to features_info.txt. This codebook will only cover the variables considered in the analysis, and how they are named.

## Selection
The following variables were selected for use in the analysis because they are the originally estimated variables in the study:
  - tBodyAcc-XYZ
  - tGravityAcc-XYZ
  - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  - tBodyGyro-XYZ
  - tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
  - tBodyAccMag
  - tGravityAccMag
  - tBodyAccJerkMag
  - tBodyGyroMag
  - tBodyGyroJerkMag
  - fBodyAcc-XYZ
  - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  - fBodyGyro-XYZ
  - fBodyAccMag
  - fBodyAccJerkMag
  - fBodyGyroMag
  - fBodyGyroJerkMag

Of these variables, the ones that contain an XYZ component were separated into their individual components. There are eight of these in total, leading to 24 separate variables. The nine other measurements give a total of 33 measurements to be considered. For the analysis, both the mean and standard deviation were taken for each of the 33 measurements. This leads to a total of 66 variables in taken from the data itself.

In addition, two other variables were included:
  - subject
  - activity

These are included to correlate a subject with an activity and all the associated signals.

## Variables
The names of the original variables were modified to avoid the use of dahses (-), dots (.), and abbreviations. For example, tBodyAcc-mean()-X would become timeBodyAccelerationMeanX.
