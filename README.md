# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

## Description
This set of scripts is used to clean and analyze data obtained from the following url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The cleaning process takes the original data, correlates subjects to activities and measurements, subsets the data so it only contains mean and standard deviation measurements, and cleans up variable names.

The analysis consists of finding the average for all the variables included in the tidy dataset for each subject performing each activity.

A more complete description of the experiment, along with the original data, can be found at the following site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Usage
1. Clone this repository using:
  - "git clone https://github.com/aarcg/GettingAndCleaningDataProject.git"
2. Change to the GettingAndCleaningDataProject" directory (for example "cd GettingAndCleaningDataProject").
3. Download the data from the following url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  - The data can be stored in either your current working directory (GettingAndCleaningDataProject), or in the "data" directory (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)). The data can remain zipped or be unzipped as long as the following naming conventions are followed.
    - Zipped data must be in a file named "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip"
    - Unzipped data must be in a directory named "UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Start R and read in the run_analysis.R script using:
  - source("run_analysis.R")
5. Reading the script in will give you a runAnalysis function. Simply invoke the function using:
  - runAnalysis()
6. The script will run and build both a tidy dataset and an analyzed dataset. These will be stored in the "output" directory with the names tidy.txt and analysis.txt respectively.

## Directory Structure
### Root directory (GettingAndCleaningDataProject/)
Contains the run_analysis.R script. Also contains the codebook and the readme.

### R directory
Contains helper scripts that are used by the main run_analysis.R script.

### data directory
The directory used to store the raw data. The data can be left in the root directory, and the script will run, but to keep things organized and the root directory clean, it is recommended that you use the data directory. The data can be stored zipped or unzipped as long as it is named as follows:
  - Zipped data must be in a file named "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip"
  - Unzipped data must be in a directory named "UCI HAR Dataset

### output directory
The directory in which you will find the results of running the script. If the script runs correctly, you will find two output files here.
  - tidy.txt - The cleaned dataset.
  - analysis.txt - The final analysis of the cleaned dataset.
